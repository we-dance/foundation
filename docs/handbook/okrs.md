# OKRs & Goals

WeDance uses OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to align our team around ambitious goals and track meaningful progress. Our OKRs are set quarterly and reviewed monthly to ensure we're building toward our 20-year vision.

## 🎯 How We Use OKRs

### Quarterly Cycle

- **Week 1-2**: Draft OKRs based on annual strategy
- **Week 3**: Team review and refinement
- **Week 4**: Final OKRs published and communicated
- **Monthly**: Progress reviews and adjustments
- **End of Quarter**: Retrospective and scoring

### OKR Principles

- **Ambitious but Achievable** - Target 70-80% completion rate
- **Measurable** - All key results have clear metrics
- **Aligned** - Support company mission and annual goals
- **Transparent** - Visible to entire team
- **Focused** - Maximum 3-5 objectives per quarter
